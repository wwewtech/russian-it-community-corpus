- **Adapter weights:** 7.06 MB, sha256 `db89937e5be97d2e286d6508b6758b088d55d9f7b0b21935dddfc1feef4dd0d8`
- **Language(s) (NLP):** Russian (ru), English technical terms
- **License:** MIT (repository license, see `LICENSE`); the base model retains its own license
- **Finetuned from model:** `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct`

## Uses

### Direct Use

Fine-tuned variant of `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct` for Russian-language IT discourse
(backend, DevOps, AI/ML, infrastructure). Load with PEFT against the same
base model:

```python
from peft import PeftModel

model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, "lora_adapters/smollm2_135m_instruct/")
```

### Out-of-Scope Use

- Not a general assistant: capability scores are **not published** (see
  benchmark retraction notice in the repository `README.md`).
- Not validated for safety-critical or legally binding advice.

## Bias, Risks and Limitations

- Training data is de-identified community chat: heuristic + probabilistic
  PII audit with a documented statistical upper bound (see
  `reports/probabilistic_pii_audit.json`), not a zero-leak guarantee.
- Chat-derived content may contain outdated or opinionated technical advice.
- Notice and takedown: see `DATASET_TERMS.md`.

## Training Details

- **Training data:** RICC SFT dialogues (171,520 curated multi-turn dialogues).
- **Training regime:** pilot domain-adaptation checkpoint — 50-100 training
  steps on sampled domain batches (statement from `reports/HF_MODEL_CARD.md`),
  **not** multi-epoch training over the whole corpus.
- **Framework:** PEFT 0.20.0 (see `adapter_config.json` in this directory).

## Evaluation

No benchmark scores are claimed for this adapter. Published academic
benchmark numbers were retracted (answer-parsing and column-mapping defects);
see the retraction notice in `README.md` before citing any evaluation figures.
